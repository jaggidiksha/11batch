        // scoping:scoping defines the visibility/accessibility of variables in different parts of your code 
        // js has primarily two types of scoping
        // global scoping
        // local scoping


        // global scoping: the variables declared outside of function/block of code are called global variables and the concept is called global scoping,the global variables are accessed anywhere in the code 

        // example
        // var a="hello";
        // function abc(){
        //     console.log(a)
        // }
        // abc()
        // console.log(a)

        // local scoping: the variables declared inside the function/block of code are called local variables abd the concept is called local scoping,the local variabels are only accessible inside the function/block they are declared in. 

        // local scoping is further divided into two types
        // function scope
        // block scope

        // function scope:the variables declared inside the function are called functional scope variables and the variables declared with var type are function scope

        // function abc(){
        //     var funscope="hey"
        // console.log(funscope)
        // }
        // abc()

        // block scope:the variables declared inside the block are called block scope variables and the variables declared with let and const  type are block scope


        // if(true){
        //     let a="hii"
        // }

        // console.log(a)



        // lexical scoping/closures:we have two funtions one is outerfuntion and other one is innerfunction,innerfuntion can access the parameters and variables of the outerfuntion
        // es6
        // arrow functions:
        //    const abc=()=>{

        //    }
        //    abc()


        // the sumof two numbers is sum

        // `` template literals /backticks
        //  ${expression name}:string interpolation

        // const outerfuntion = (a) => {
        //     let b = 90;
        //     const innerfunction = () => {
        //         let sum = a + b
        //         console.log(`the sum of two numbers is ${sum}`)
        //         //  console.log("the sum of two numbers is ",sum)

        //     }
        //     innerfunction()

        // }
        // outerfuntion(80)


        //    localStorage: localstorage is a client side web storage feature that allows you to store the data as a key value pair ,the storage capacity can vary between different browsers but typically ranges between 5-10 mb and the limitation of localstorage is that it can only store the key value pair data , if we want to store more complex data we can go for other client side web storage features like indexDB .

        // to set the item
        localStorage.setItem("username", "dikshajaggi")

        // to get the item
        let a = localStorage.getItem("username")
        console.log(a)
