<p>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[4] in the family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[4] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars.[5] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[6] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds.</p>

<p>Lilium (/ˈlɪliəm/ LIL-ee-əm)[3] is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants growing from bulbs, all with large and often prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most species are native to the Northern Hemisphere and their range is temperate climates and extends into the subtropics. Many other plants have "lily" in their common names, but do not belong to the same genus and are therefore not true lilies</p>

<h1>LOTUS</h1>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Sacred_lotus_Nelumbo_nucifera.jpg/330px-Sacred_lotus_Nelumbo_nucifera.jpg">
<p>Nelumbo nucifera, also known as Padma (Sanskrit: पद्म, romanized: Padmā, lit. 'Lotus') or Kamala (Sanskrit: कमल, lit. 'Lotus'), sacred lotus, Indian lotus,[1] or simply lotus, is one of two extant species of aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. It is sometimes colloquially called a water lily, though this more often refers to members of the family Nymphaeaceae.[2]

Lotus plants are adapted to grow in the flood plains of slow-moving rivers and delta areas. Stands of lotus drop hundreds of thousands of seeds every year to the bottom of the pond.</p>
